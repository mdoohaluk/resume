                 <dd class="alpha">Lotus is a board game developed using javascript. Two players compete by moving
                 their pieces towards a mutual goal. Pieces pile up in stacks on the game board and the distance
                 they can move is dictated by the height of the stack they currently occupy.</dd><br></div>
    	    <div class="bnb"><dt class="beta"><h3>Bishkies and Boshkies</h3></dt>
                 <dd class="beta">Bishkies and boskies is a placeholder element. I will replace this later with a
                 real project or maybe turn bishkies and boskies into some kind of game.</dd><br></div>
    	    <div class="thirdthing"><dt class="gamma"><h3>Third Thing</h3></dt>
                 <dd class="gamma">Third thing is another placeholder element. This one will be replaced as I cannot
                 think of something funny or worthwhile that would adequately fit the title of third thing</dd><br></div>
            <div class="dungeoner"><dt class="alpha"><h3>Dungeoner</h3></dt>
                 <dd class="alpha">Dungeoner is going to be a basic text-based dungeon crawler ideally made with
                 something other than javascript, but may be made with javascript if that ends up being the best way
                 to do it.</dd><br></div>
            <div class="michaeldew"><dt class="beta"><h3>Michael Dew</h3></dt>
                 <dd class="beta">The Michael Dew webpage is a mark-up of a website for a fiction energy drink
                 called Michael Dew.</dd><br></div>
            <div class="dungeonertwo"><dt class="gamma"><h3>Dungeoner II</h3></dt>
                <dd class="gamma">The sequel to Dungeoner, possibly. This will be a platformer that may have some
                stylistic similarities to dungeoner, but possibly not. It will likely be a single screen puzzler
                where you may have to collect some trinkets of some sort to advance.</dd><br></div>
            <div class="tetris"><dt class="alpha"><h3>Tetrocity</h3></dt>
                <dd class="alpha">A tetris clone with some added elements, likely five block pieces and some other
                surprises.</dd><br></div>
            <div class="dungeonerthree"><dt class="beta"><h3>Dungeoner III: The Dungeoning</h3></dt>
                <dd class="beta">The third chapter in the Duneoner trilogy! Realistically, at this point I'm just
                trying to make sure I have a good number of elements on the page so I can test the html and css
                layouts properly but who knows maybe this will actually become a thing.</dd></div>
